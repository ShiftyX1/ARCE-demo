# ARCE Demo Builds

Compiled demo builds for games created with ARCE (Advanced RayCast Engine).

## About
This repository contains ready-to-run game builds developed with the ARCE engine. No source code - only executable files for testing and demonstrating engine capabilities.

**ARCE** is a modern take on classic Quake/GoldSrc-style shooters, built on Godot Engine with Qodot integration.

## System Requirements
- Windows 10+, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), macOS 10.15+
- 2 GB RAM
- OpenGL 3.3 support

## Available Builds
Demo builds will be added here as they become available.

## Controls
- **WASD** - movement
- **Mouse** - camera
- **Space** - jump
- **~** - developer console (will be added soon)

## Source Code
The engine source code may be released later (I hope I will). ARCE is based on Godot Engine and utilizes Qodot and Trenchbroom for level editing.
